## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r EDA}
glimpse(d.counties)
glimpse(d.counties)
```
```{r functions}
d.counties %>% dplyr::select(GEOID10, ALAND10) %>% head()

d.counties %>% dplyr::select(GEOID10:CLASSFP10) %>% head()

d.counties %>% dplyr::select(~(GEOID10:CLASSFP10)) %>% head()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
